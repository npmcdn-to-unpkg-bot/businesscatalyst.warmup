<h2>Grouping</h2>
It is possible to group items in a WebApp by a specific field. To do this you can use the Grouping Liquid Library. Copy the code in the top of the library and adjust the values to your specifications.

<hr>
{% assign app_id = "36672" -%}
{% assign groupType = "state" -%}
{% assign groupTitle = "h2" -%}
{% capture groupHead %}
<table class="table table-responsive">
    <tr>
    	<th>Item Name</th>
        <th>Address</th>
        <th>Phone</th>
        <th>Fax</th>
        <th>Company</th>
        <th>Email</th>
    </tr>
{% endcapture -%}
{% capture groupFoot %}
</table>
{% endcapture -%}
